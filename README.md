# MIPS Assembly Scripting Project

Welcome to the MIPS Assembly Scripting project! This repository contains a collection of MIPS assembly language scripts that cover a wide range of fundamental arithmetic and mathematical operations. Whether you're new to MIPS assembly or looking to explore advanced calculations, this project provides a valuable resource for learning and experimentation.

## Features

This project includes a variety of MIPS assembly programs that demonstrate essential arithmetic and mathematical operations, including:

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Addition and subtraction operations to perform simple calculations.

- **Division**: Implementation of division operations, including handling remainders.

- **Power Calculation**: Calculate powers and exponents efficiently.

- **Factorial**: Compute factorials of numbers using iterative or recursive methods.

- **Backward Addition**: A unique algorithm that performs addition in a reverse order.

## Prerequisites

To run the MIPS assembly scripts in this project, you'll need:

- A MIPS assembly simulator or emulator, such as SPIM or MARS, installed on your computer.
